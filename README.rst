About TrackFil
============

The TrackFil software provides an algorithm to automatically track filaments on Sun images.

TrackFil was initially developped in the framework of the HELIO Virtual Observatory European project (http://www.helio-vo.eu/),
to populate its Heliophysics Feature Catalogue (HFC).
TrackFil data results on the Meudon Spectroheliograph observations are available in the HFC web portal at: http://hfc.helio-vo.eu.

The software algorithm is described in details in: http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11207-012-9985-9.

====================

The TrackFil package contains the TrackFil source code, as well as scripts to
install and configure the software.

It shall store the following items:

     /bin
        binary files (e.g., idl runtime file to launch trackfil).
     /config   configuration files providing input parameters.
     /scripts  scripts to run trackfil.
     /src      code source files (written in IDL).
     /tools    extra tools (e.g., program to train trackfil).
